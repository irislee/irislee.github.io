    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen something like this before:
<code>ruby
foo = "Chunky"
bar = "Bacon!"
puts foo + " " + bar
=&gt; Chunky Bacon!
</code>
But what is the origin of using &ldquo;foo,&rdquo; &ldquo;bar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;baz&rdquo; as placeholder names in pseudocode (aka  metasyntactic variables)? According to the interwebs, &ldquo;foo&rdquo; first emerged as a nonsense word in the 1930s in the comic <i>Smokey Stover</i> by Bill Holman and became popular in other cartoons at the time. From there, &ldquo;foo&rdquo; merged with the military acronym <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR#FUBAR">FUBAR</a>, which arose in the armed forces during WWII. The use of &ldquo;foo&rdquo; in programming, however, is credited to MIT&rsquo;s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) in the 1960s.</p>

<p>The TMRC is celebrated due to its developmental role in hacker culture.
Foo&rsquo;s first appearance in print was in a 1965 edition of MIT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tech Engineering News.&rdquo; In TMRC&rsquo;s train model system, there were scram switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if a train was going to crash into something. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch, the clock stopped and would instead display the word &ldquo;foo,&rdquo; thus why they were called &ldquo;foo&rdquo; switches.</p>

<p>The train room also had two buttons by the door labeled &ldquo;foo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bar&rdquo;. They were often re-purposed for whatever fun idea the TMRC had at the time, hence the adoption of &ldquo;foo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bar&rdquo; as general purpose variable names. &ldquo;Baz&rdquo; exists simply because Stanford preferred &ldquo;baz&rdquo; over &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The terms were made popular through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s by system manuals from the Digital Equipment Corporation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORTRAN">Fortran&rsquo;s</a> code for <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</a></i>.</p>

<p>Pseudocode in other countries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK: wibble, wobble, fred, flob</li>
  <li>France: toto, tata, tutu, bidule, azerty (French keyboard's asdf)</li>
  <li>Japan: hoge, piyo, fuga, hogera</li>
  <li>Isarael: chupchick, stam</li>
  <li>Italy: pippo, pluto, paperino</li>
  <li>Spain: fulano, mengano, zutano</li>
</ul>




<h2>TL;DR</h2>


<ul>
  <li>"foo" is a nonsense word from 1930s comics.</li>
  <li>FUBAR comes from US military slang during WWII.</li>
  <li>MIT's Tech Model Train Club popularized the terms for tinkering/hacking.</li>
  <li>Use "foo", bar, and baz to test out concepts so you don't cause a SNAFU and make your code FUBAR.</li>
  <li>What about "Hello, World"? It comes from <em><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)">The C Programming Language</a></em>.</li>
  <li>What about "Chunky Bacon"? It comes from <em><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why's_(poignant)_Guide_to_Ruby">why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
